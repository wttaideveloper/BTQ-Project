Please apply the following updates to the existing Bible Trivia web app project:

🔧 BUG FIXES:

1. On the **Home Page**:
   - Change the **background color** of the login/logout button to a shade that complements the existing dark theme (e.g., dark blue, #2c3e50).

2. On the **Questions Page**:
   - Update the **background color** of the "Skip" button to match the dark aesthetic — use a contrasting accent like #34495e or #3b3b3b.

3. In **Multiplayer Mode**:
   - Fix the display of **player statistics** — ensure each player's data is clearly separated (e.g., use cards or distinct sections with names, score, accuracy).

4. Fix **audio feedback** system:
   - Add celebration sound (e.g., short victory jingle) for correct answers.
   - Add “error” or buzzer sound for wrong answers.
   - Add countdown alert (e.g., ticking or beep) when timer is under 5 seconds.

5. In the Avatar system:
   - Change the avatar name to **Master Eli** everywhere.
   - Replace current voice with a **new male voice** (use another TTS voice or male audio file) — ensure it sounds warm and encouraging.

6. Update the **Login/Register modal** styling:
   - Set a background color that complements the rest of the app’s dark UI — preferably a mid-dark gradient or a dark semi-transparent overlay (#1e272e or rgba(0,0,0,0.7)).

7. Fix the **Rewards System**:
   - Ensure rewards are correctly given based on:
     • 3–5 correct: Book
     • 6–9 correct: Cap
     • 10–12 correct: T-Shirt
   - Remove the generation of **digital certificates after every game**. Certificates should only be triggered when all questions are answered correctly (full completion).

✨ NEW FEATURE:

8. Add a **Leaderboard Page**:
   - Display top players sorted by score (descending).
   - Show: player name, total score, games played, accuracy (%).
   - Allow filtering by single/multiplayer.
   - Leaderboard data should update in real-time (if multiplayer) using WebSockets or refresh periodically.
   - Link the Leaderboard in the main navigation menu.

🧪 QA:
- Make sure all sounds trigger at appropriate times.
- Validate the reward system logic.
- Ensure leaderboard updates after each game.
- Ensure avatar changes take effect immediately.

Make all updates without further checkpoints unless critical clarification is needed.
