Please update the Multiplayer feature of the Bible Trivia Game to include both:

1. Real-time synchronous multiplayer gameplay (from previous command), and  
2. A new asynchronous challenge mode where players can compete at different times.

🔁 MODE 1: REAL-TIME MULTIPLAYER (Remote)
- As previously instructed:
  • Players from different locations can join the same game session using a shared code.
  • Real-time synchronization using WebSockets.
  • Show current turn, timer, stats, etc., to all players.

⚔️ MODE 2: ASYNCHRONOUS CHALLENGE SYSTEM

1. **Challenge a Player**:
   - Any player can issue a challenge to another registered player from their profile or multiplayer menu.
   - Choose a category or mixed difficulty for the challenge.

2. **Asynchronous Gameplay**:
   - Player A completes their round of 10 questions.
   - Player B can respond to the challenge later (within a time limit, e.g., 24 hours).
   - Both play independently; scores are saved and compared.

3. **Scoring & Outcome**:
   - After both players complete their turns, display a summary:
     • Scores side by side
     • Correct answers
     • Time taken (optional)
   - Winner is highlighted; add win/loss stats to user profile.

4. **Notification System**:
   - Notify Player B (via in-app notification or email) when a challenge is received.
   - Notify both players once the challenge is complete.

5. **Challenge History**:
   - Add a "My Challenges" section showing:
     • Ongoing
     • Completed
     • Won/Lost record

6. **Fair Play Controls**:
   - Players cannot retry a challenge once started.
   - The same set of questions is used for both players in a challenge.

🧪 QA:
- Ensure real-time mode and challenge mode are completely functional and independent.
- Test asynchronous flow end-to-end:
  • Challenge → Response → Result
- Confirm synchronization, UI flow, score comparison, and stats are correct.

Please implement this full multiplayer system with minimal checkpoints unless clarification is necessary.
